Below are our first results where the class was able to make their own animations. Each student created their own clay figures then a group of students worked together on a single production. The students came up with ideas about how to have their characters work together and then Max and I helped make it happen. In the first group, the students placed the figures, I did the motion, and Max recorded the animation. In the second group, we got more adventurous and students took turns moving their figure for each frame. Some students got a chance to click the mouse to capture a frame of animation. It was a fun experiment. Next week we plan to work in smaller groups to create another claymation performance.
